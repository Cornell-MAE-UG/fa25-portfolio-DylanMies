For this project, my group and I dissected a small humidifier, and created a short video detailing the fluid-mechanical concepts that drive the flow in the system. 
My roles in this project were: taking apart the humidifer, researching the fluid-mechanical concepts behind the fluid flow in all parts of the humidifer, writing the script for the siphon part of the humidifier, and reading the siphon section in the video. I also assisted my teammates in any ways they needed.
